    <p class="text_box">
      Superheroes are our knights in shining armor but sometimes life can be a
      bit much and when you are underappreciated some succumb to their bad
      habits such as alcoholism. Here are some examples of our favorite super
      heros succumbing to their bad habits.
    </p>
    <h2 class="center">Spider-Man</h2>
    <p class="text_box">
      Spider man is one of the candidates that we've helped. Although we cannot

    <h2 class="center">Superman</h2>
    <p class="text_box">
      Another one of our heroes that has struggled with addiction is superman.
      He is invulnerable when it comes to physical attacks but at one time his
      emotions got the best of him and he turned to alcohol for his problems. He
      is now two years sober and has no problem rejecting the temptation of
      alcohol.

      mentality. He has a rough time coping with many losses in his life. As he
      is still struggling addiction he is making great steps towards recovery.
